Instructions for Using the Script with Jamf Pro

Overview
This script is designed to automate the installation of Command Line Tools (CLT) and Homebrew on macOS devices. The script first checks the macOS version, installs the appropriate version of CLT if not already installed, and then proceeds to install Homebrew. It verifies the installation of both CLT and Homebrew, and updates the user's shell configuration files to include Homebrew paths.

Prerequisites
- macOS 10.7 or higher**: The script is compatible with macOS versions starting from 10.7 (Lion) up to the latest versions.
- Jamf Pro**: Ensure you have access to Jamf Pro and the necessary permissions to upload and deploy scripts.

 Uploading the Script to Jamf Pro
1. Log in to Jamf Pro**: Access your Jamf Pro dashboard.
2. Navigate to Scripts:
   - Go to **Computers** > **Management Settings** > **Scripts**.
   - Click **New** to create a new script.
3. Paste the Script:
   - Name your script appropriately, e.g., "Install CLT and Homebrew".
   - In the **Script field, paste the entire Bash script.
4. Set Parameters** (if needed):
   - You may configure script parameters if there are any configurable options in your script.
5. Save the Script: Click **Save** to finalize the script.

Deploying the Script with a Jamf Pro Policy
1. Create a New Policy:
   - Go to **Computers > **Policies** > **New**.
2. Configure the Policy:
   - General: Name the policy and select the target devices or device groups.
   - Scripts: Add the script you uploaded earlier by selecting it from the list.
   - Trigger & Execution Frequency**: Choose the appropriate trigger (e.g., Recurring Check-in, Self Service) and execution frequency (e.g., Once per Computer).
3. Scope the Policy**:
   - Define the scope by targeting specific devices or groups that need the CLT and Homebrew installation.
4. Save & Deploy: Save the policy, and it will be deployed to the selected devices.


Additional Notes
- Security Considerations**: Ensure that the script is only executed on trusted devices and environments. Review and test the script in a controlled environment before mass deployment.
- Script Logging**: The script includes echo statements for logging purposes. These can help in debugging if the installation fails.

By following these instructions, you can efficiently deploy the script using Jamf Pro and maintain it in a GitHub repository for easy access and version control.
